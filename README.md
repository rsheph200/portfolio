This is a brief readme about my portfolio project

What I plan to do is:
+ create a homepage with an intro and some of my projects.
+ An about page on me.
+ contact page with some working forms.
+ have it so that this is all responsive.
+ get to know branches and merging.
+ see if I can publish to a subdomain...
+ write a proper README file.
+ Need to add some JS.
